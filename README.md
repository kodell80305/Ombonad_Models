This is a phone mount I've designed.   It's using an old phone mount for a car that had a 17 mm ball attachment.   This seemed like a good chance to learn the sweep/revolve tools.   The mount slips over one of the legs and works with the retainer I designed to keep the table centered beween the legs:

The ring goes on the leg first to provide a spacer and then the retainer.  I'll include some photos when I get a chance.   The phone/tablet holder replaces the ring but still uses the retainer.

I'm learning Fusion 36 modeling.  This is a storage place for some design changes I've made to the Ombonad Dune Weaver sand able
