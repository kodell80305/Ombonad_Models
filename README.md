Not much to say, there is a redesigned platform for the arm (the helicopter landing pad), a motor guard (these are not in correct orientation relative to the rest of the parts).

I've designed a retainer for the legs to keep the table centered.

There a new rim and a system of clips to put a 3d printed translucent led diffuser.

Stand project box to hold pi zero 2w and mks dlc32, clips to mount underneath the table

Phone mount that replaces the spacer on the retaining clip, uses an old phone mount I had that took a 17 mm ball

The new rim seperator is mostly aesthetics.  I added a dividing groove to hide the expanse of plastic and champhered the edges where the joints are.  Everything is designed to have minimal gap at the joints.

To some extent these are mostly exercises in learning Fusion 360 ... as originally built/designed by Tuan of Dune Weaver https://github.com/tuanchris/dune-weaver everything worked fine.
